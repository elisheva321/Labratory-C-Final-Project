notes:
- all internal functions (functions that are not exposed to the user of the library) will start with prefix "_".
- we used in the project LOGGER. all logs will be written into "logfile.txt"
- line count refers to the am file and not the original file.
- in case of an error in pre processor stage, we will not continue to first/second pass.
- in case of an error in first_pass we do continue to second pass to find more errors if possible.
