# Labratory C final Project 
This is the Final project (mmn 14) in Laboratory C 20465- 2024A course at the Open University. This project was developed as part of the "20465 - Systems Programming Laboratory" 2024A course at the Open University. It's a comprehensive assembler program for a specific assembly language, written in C. The purpose is to simulate the operation of common system programs, and thus experience writing a large-scale software project.
Written by Elisheva Cirota and Daniel Oren.

notes:
- all internal functions (functions that are not exposed to the user of the library) will start with prefix "_".
- we used in the project LOGGER. all logs will be written into "logfile.txt"
- line count refers to the am file and not the original file.
- in case of an error in pre processor stage, we will not continue to first/second pass.
- in case of an error in first_pass we do continue to second pass to find more errors if possible.
